MANUAL METHOD (EASIEST):

2. Inside the "battle" folder, create a new folder called "models"
3. From "Poly.Pizza Models.undefined-glb" folder, select all 16 GLB files
4. Copy and paste them into "battle/models/"

TERMINAL METHOD:

Open Terminal and run these commands:

cd /Users/suedagul/battle
mkdir -p models
cp "/Users/suedagul/Poly.Pizza Models.undefined-glb/"*.glb models/

VERIFY IT WORKED:

Run: ls /Users/suedagul/battle/models/
You should see 16 files listed.

Then reload your browser at http://localhost:8000 and test!
